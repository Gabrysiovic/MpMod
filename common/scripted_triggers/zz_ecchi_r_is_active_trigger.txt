# ECCHI REDUX CHECK SCRPITED TRIGGERS #
#######################################

# You can use this trigger to see if Ecchi Redux is active for in a playset.
# This is useful if you want your mod to interact with Ecchi Redux.

# You can use it by adding a scripted_trigger_file in your mod.
# The File name should start with "00_", so that it gets loaded before this file.
# Add this to your file (without the "#" obviously):

#ecchi_r_is_active = {
#	always = no
#}

# Now you can use the trigger like this: "ecchi_r_is_active = yes".
# If Ecchi Redux is active the Trigger here will take priority and it will result in a "yes".
# If Ecchi Redux is not active your Trigger will be used and the Trigger will return "no".

ecchi_r_is_active = {
	always = yes
}
