	### Pop Consolidation defines
	# Pop Consolidation identifies pops so small their impact on the economy and politics is insignificant, and merges them into other pops in the same building or state.
	# 
	# POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE_*: determines how small the pop needs to be in terms of Workforce in order to qualify to be merged with others in their same building or the unemployment pool
	# POP_MERGE_MIN_NUM_POPS_SAME_PROFESSION_*: employed pops will not get merged with others in their same building if there aren't at least this many pops of the same type in the building
	# WORKFORCE_RATIO_MAX_UNEMPLOYMENT_FACTOR_*: unemployed Pops with less than POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE and a Workforce:Dependent ratio that's this much worse than the ideal will be all turned into Dependents and merged back into pops in the same state
	# 
	# The tail of the define name corresponds to a Pop Consolidation Game Rule with the same name. 
	# When that Game Rule is active, the defined values for POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE and WORKFORCE_RATIO_MAX_UNEMPLOYMENT_FACTOR represent the minimum values, while the maximum are that of the level above it.
	# POP_MERGE_START_POP and POP_MERGE_MAX_TARGET_POP determines how high to scale the values towards the level above it.
	# For example, at Moderate Consolidation, POP_MERGE_START_POP = 50000 and POP_MERGE_MAX_TARGET_POP = 100000, and a global population of 87560 pops:
	# POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE will effectively be 45 (75% of the way from 30 to 50) and WORKFORCE_RATIO_MAX_UNEMPLOYMENT_FACTOR will effectively be 1.6244 (75% of the way from 2 to 1.5)
